      Beginning on January 7, 2025, a series of wildfires broke out in the Los Angeles area. In addition to the devastating damage caused by the fires, large amounts of particulate matter, NO<sub>2</sub>, and other pollutants were released into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TEMPO instrument can detect the NO<sub>2</sub> plumes from these fires,
      helping scientists and the public to understand the extent of the pollution and how it moves through the air.

      Compare levels of NO<sub>2</sub> before, during, and after the fires.

      During the fires, NO<sub>2</sub> levels far exceeded the default range displayed on our maps. For Jan 7 - Feb 2, 2025, we added an option to use an extended range of NO<sub>2</sub> values. For those dates, a button appears on the map to toggle between the standard and extended range.
